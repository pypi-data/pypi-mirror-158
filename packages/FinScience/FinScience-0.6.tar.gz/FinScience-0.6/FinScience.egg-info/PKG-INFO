This library allows you to use four functions based on t he alternative-data metrics provided by FinScience s.r.l., namely the popularity and sentiment.

The Trend_Indicator function is a financial technical indicator based on machine learning model LightGBM, that allows you to predict the trend of returns

In particular, the SiSS function apply over a single title the so called "Signal Screener Strategy", which is an algorithmic function based on signals provided by sentiment and popularity.

The TI-SiSS is similar to the SiSS except for the fact that it is extremely dependent on the FinScience metrics since it exploits also the Trend Indicator
