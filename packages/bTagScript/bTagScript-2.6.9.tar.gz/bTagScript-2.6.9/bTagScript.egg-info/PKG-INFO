**This is my own implementation of TagScript. Will write documentation for how to use this later.**

This repository is a fork of JonSnowbd's [TagScript](https://github.com/JonSnowbd/TagScript), a string templating language.

This fork is also from Phenom4n4n's forked version of the original TagScript package.

Documentation on the bTagScript library can be [found here](https://btagscript.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Benchmarks (Performance Testing)

### July 08, 2022

Testing for this benchmark used the following seeds and test strings, and was ran `1,000` times.

```yaml
Seeds: {message: Hello, this is my message.}
Test String: {message} {#:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} {range:1-9} {$variablename:Hello World} {variablename} {message} {strf:Its %A}
```

Note that this was adjusted for different syntax, {=(variablename):Hello World}
