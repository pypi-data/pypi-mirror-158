# Datalake Framework

A Python framework for working with a datalake's cloud assets like **data catalog**, **storage**, **monitoring** or **secrets**

The framework helps making abstraction of cloud resources when developing use-cases for a datalake. Supported cloud providers are

- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Google Cloud Plaform](https://cloud.google.com/)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)

Additionnaly, most cloud features in the framework are available for **local development**. Hence developers can work on use-cases without requiring a full cloud insfrastructure or even work offline.
