Kaolin is a PyTorch library aiming to accelerate 3D deep learning research. Kaolin provides efficient implementations
of differentiable 3D modules for use in deep learning systems. With functionality to load and preprocess several popular
3D datasets, and native functions to manipulate meshes, pointclouds, signed distance functions, and voxel grids, Kaolin
mitigates the need to write wasteful boilerplate code. Kaolin packages together several differentiable graphics modules
including rendering, lighting, shading, and view warping. Kaolin also supports an array of loss functions and evaluation
metrics for seamless evaluation and provides visualization functionality to render the 3D results. Importantly, we curate
a comprehensive model zoo comprising many state-of-the-art 3D deep learning architectures, to serve as a starting point
for future research endeavours.
