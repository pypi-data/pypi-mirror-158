## Typing stubs for Flask-Cors

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `Flask-Cors` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `Flask-Cors`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/Flask-Cors. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `9ccf4589a0cc8f0c5a8cc2c07c485da6d7118767`.
