Intro

Theta Data API offers a low latency approach to retrieving historical options data. 
All APIs are designed without compromising simplicity, performance, or customization. 
This documentation will be updated every major release. The first page will always
display the date this was last updated, the API version, and the Theta Terminal
version the documentation uses.


Additional Information

A Theta Data subscription is required to access data. The Theta Terminal must be running
to make requests. Visit https://thetadata.net for more info.
