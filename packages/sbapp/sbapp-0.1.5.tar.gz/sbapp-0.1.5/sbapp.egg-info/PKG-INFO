# Sideband

Sideband is an LXMF client for Android, Linux and macOS. It allows you to communicate with other people or LXMF-compatible systems over Reticulum networks using LoRa, Packet Radio, WiFi, I2P, or anything else Reticulum supports.

Sideband is completely free, anonymous and infrastructure-less. Sideband uses the completely peer-to-peer and distributed messaging system [LXMF](https://github.com/markqvist/lxmf "LXMF"). There is no service providers, no "end-user license agreements", no data theft and no surveillance. You own the system.

Sideband currently includes basic functionality for secure and independent communication, and many useful features are planned for implementation. To get a feel for the idea behind Sideband, you can download it and try it out now. Please help make all the functionality a reality by supporting the development with donations.

Sideband is currently provided as an early alpha-quality preview release. No user support is provided other than the published articles, tutorials and documentation resources. You are welcome to try it out and use it in any way you please. Please report any bugs or unexpected behaviours. Please expect this program to implode the known universe.

If you want to help develop this program, get in touch.
