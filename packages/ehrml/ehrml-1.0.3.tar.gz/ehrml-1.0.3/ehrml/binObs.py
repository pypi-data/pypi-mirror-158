    """Use configuration and observations to create a list of data for each bin.
       Fields with the 'binary' as 'transformation' are collapsed such that any
       true in the time range associated with the bin means the field is set to
       true, otherwise false. Otherwise, the most recent value is used.

    Args:
        config:
            list of dicts, each containing configuration for a field of interest.
        observations:
            A list of dicts representing observations, each with its value,
            field, and time.
        numBins:
            The total number of bins to produce at the end
        binLength:
            The size of each bin in hours. Should evenly divide a day.
        now (optional):
            An override to the current time. Used primarily for testing.

    Returns:
        A list of dicts representing bins, each with values associated with the
        time range that bin represents.
