# QtStrap: Qt application bootstrapping framework


[![license](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/qtstrap.svg)](./LICENSE)
[![pypi version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/qtstrap.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/QtPy/)

Qt is excellent, but it's also enormous. There's a lot of topics, and many of them have hidden gotchas. PySide2 and PyQt are also excellent, letting us leverage the powerful Qt libraries from up in the clouds in PythonLand, but this arrangement has its own gotchas. 

The goal of qtstrap is get your applications up and running quickly, so you can focus on your problem instead of on Qt's idiosyncracies.
