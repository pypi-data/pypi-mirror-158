# Mybox

🖥️ This is a box. 📦 And it is mine. 🐱

There are many 🍱 nice things in there. I wouldn't want 🧰 to be without them.

Even if I move 🏠 or work 🏢 I want to be comfortable.

---

Manage the configuration and tools on your workstation without bothering the OS
too much (maybe your favorite one isn't supported by `$WORK` or you have
different ones for different roles).

## Status

In development, for the current horrible state of affairs see
[install](https://github.com/koterpillar/desktop/blob/main/install).
