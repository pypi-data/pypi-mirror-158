# Deweathered Percentage Changes (DePC)

a function for calculating deweathered percentage changes

## description

- 1) reconstructing the time series of data in any two years to the same size; 
- 2) conducting correlation analysis using the reconstructed data in any two years and removing outliers after the inflection point; 
- 3) repeating step 2) to remove more outliers; 
- 4) calculating the range of DePC; 
- 5) evaluating residual perturbations by varying weather conditions.
