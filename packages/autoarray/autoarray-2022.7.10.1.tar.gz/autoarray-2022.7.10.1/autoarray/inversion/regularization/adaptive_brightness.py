        """
        An adaptive regularization scheme (regularization is described in the `Regularization` class above).

        For the weighted regularization scheme, each pixel is given an 'effective regularization weight', which is \
        applied when each set of pixel neighbors are regularized with one another. The motivation of this is that \
        different regions of a pixelization require different levels of regularization (e.g., high smoothing where the \
        no signal is present and less smoothing where it is, see (Nightingale, Dye and Massey 2018)).

        Unlike the instance regularization_matrix scheme, neighboring pixels must now be regularized with one another \
        in both directions (e.g. if pixel 0 regularizes pixel 1, pixel 1 must also regularize pixel 0). For example:

        B = [-1, 1]  [0->1]
            [-1, -1]  1 now also regularizes 0

        For a instance regularization coefficient this would NOT produce a positive-definite matrix. However, for
        the weighted scheme, it does!

        The regularize weight_list change the B matrix as shown below - we simply multiply each pixel's effective \
        regularization weight by each row of B it has a -1 in, so:

        regularization_weights = [1, 2, 3, 4]

        B = [-1, 1, 0 ,0] # [0->1]
            [0, -2, 2 ,0] # [1->2]
            [0, 0, -3 ,3] # [2->3]
            [4, 0, 0 ,-4] # [3->0]

        If our -1's werent down the diagonal this would look like:

        B = [4, 0, 0 ,-4] # [3->0]
            [0, -2, 2 ,0] # [1->2]
            [-1, 1, 0 ,0] # [0->1]
            [0, 0, -3 ,3] # [2->3] This is valid!

class AdaptiveBrightnessSplit(AdaptiveBrightness):
    def __init__(self, inner_coefficient=1.0, outer_coefficient=1.0, signal_scale=1.0):
        """
        An adaptive regularization scheme which splits every source pixel into a cross of four regularization points
        (regularization is described in the `Regularization` class above) and interpolates to these points in order
        to apply smoothing on the solution of an `Inversion`.

        The size of this cross is determined via the size of the source-pixel, for example if the source pixel is a
        Voronoi pixel the area of the pixel is computed and the distance of each point of the cross is given by
        the area times 0.5.
