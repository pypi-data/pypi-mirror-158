        """
        A pixelization associates a 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates (which are expected to be aligned with a masked
        dataset) with a 2D grid of pixels.

        The Delaunay pixelization represents pixels as an irregular 2D grid of Delaunay triangles.

        Both of these grids (e.g. the masked dataset's 2D grid and the grid of the Delaunay pixelization's pixels)
        have (y,x) coordinates in two reference frames:

        - `data`: the original reference frame of the masked data.

        - `source`: a reference frame where grids in the `data` reference frame are transformed to a new reference
        frame (e.g. their (y,x) coordinates may be shifted, stretched or have a more complicated operation performed
        on them).

        The grid associated with the masked dataset and Delaunay pixelization have the following variable names:

        - `grid_slim`: the (y,x) grid of coordinates of the original masked data (which can be in the data frame and
        given the variable name `data_grid_slim` or in the transformed source frame with the variable
        name `source_grid_slim`).

        - `pixelization_grid`: the (y,x) grid of Delaunay pixels which are associated with the `grid_slim` (y,x)
        coordinates (association is always performed in the `source` reference frame).

        A Delaunay pixelization has four grids associated with it: `data_grid_slim`, `source_grid_slim`,
        `data_pixelization_grid` and `source_pixelization_grid`.

        If a transformation of coordinates is not applied, the `data` frame and `source` frames are identical.

        The (y,x) coordinates of the `source_pixelization_grid` represent the corners of the triangles in the
        Delaunay triangulation.

        Each (y,x) coordinate in the `source_grid_slim` is associated with the three nearest Delaunay triangle
        corners. This association uses a weighted interpolation scheme whereby every `source_grid_slim` coordinate is
        associated to Delaunay triangle corners with a higher weight if they are a closer distance to it.

        In the project `PyAutoLens`, one's data is a masked 2D image. Its `data_grid_slim` is a 2D grid where every
        (y,x) coordinate is aligned with the centre of every unmasked image pixel. A "lensing operation" transforms
        this grid of (y,x) coordinates from the `data` frame to a new grid of (y,x) coordinates in the `source` frame.
        The pixelization is then applied in the source frame.. In lensing terminology, the `data` frame is
        the `image-plane` and `source` frame the `source-plane`.

        Mapper objects describe the mappings between pixels in the masked 2D data and the pixels in a pixelization,
        in both the `data` and `source` frames.

        This function returns a `MapperDelaunay` as follows:

        1) Before this routine is called, a sparse grid of (y,x) coordinates are computed from the 2D masked data,
        the `data_pixelization_grid`, which acts as the Delaunay pixel centres of the pixelization and mapper.

        2) Before this routine is called, operations are performed on this `data_pixelization_grid` that transform it
        from a 2D grid which overlaps with the 2D mask of the data in the `data` frame to an irregular grid in
        the `source` frame, the `source_pixelization_grid`.

        3) If `settings.use_border=True`, the border of the input `source_grid_slim` is used to relocate all of the
        grid's (y,x) coordinates beyond the border to the edge of the border.

        4) If `settings.use_border=True`, the border of the input `source_grid_slim` is used to relocate all of the
        transformed `source_pixelization_grid`'s (y,x) coordinates beyond the border to the edge of the border.

        5) Use the transformed `source_pixelization_grid`'s (y,x) coordinates as the centres of the Delaunay
        pixelization.

        6) Return the `MapperDelaunay`.

        A pixelization associates a 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates (which are expected to be aligned with a masked
        dataset) with a 2D grid of pixels. The Delaunay pixelization represents pixels as an irregular 2D grid of
        Delaunay triangles.

        Both of these grids (e.g. the masked dataset's 2D grid and the grid of the Delaunay pixelization's pixels)
        have (y,x) coordinates in two reference frames:

        - `data`: the original reference frame of the masked data.

        - `source`: a reference frame where grids in the `data` reference frame are transformed to a new reference
        frame (e.g. their (y,x) coordinates may be shifted, stretched or have a more complicated operation performed
        on them).

        The grid associated with the masked dataset and Delaunay pixelization have the following variable names:

        - `grid_slim`: the (y,x) grid of coordinates of the original masked data (which can be in the data frame and
        given the variable name `data_grid_slim` or in the transformed source frame with the variable
        name `source_grid_slim`).

        - `pixelization_grid`: the (y,x) grid of Delaunay pixels which are associated with the `grid_slim` (y,x)
        coordinates (association is always performed in the `source` reference frame).

        A Delaunay pixelization has four grids associated with it: `data_grid_slim`, `source_grid_slim`,
        `data_pixelization_grid` and `source_pixelization_grid`.

        If a transformation of coordinates is not applied, the `data` frame and `source` frames are identical.

        Each (y,x) coordinate in the `source_grid_slim` is associated with the three nearest Delaunay triangle
        corners (when joined together with straight lines these corners form Delaunay triangles). This association
        uses weighted interpolation whereby `source_grid_slim` coordinates are associated to the Delaunay corners with
        a higher weight if they are a closer distance to one another.

        For the `DelaunayMagnification` pixelization the corners of the Delaunay pixels are derived in the `data` frame,
        by overlaying a uniform grid with the input `shape` over the masked data's grid. All coordinates in this
        uniform grid which are contained within the mask are kept, have the same transformation applied to them as the
        masked data's grid to map them to the source frame, where they form the pixelization's Delaunay pixel centres.

        In the project `PyAutoLens`, one's data is a masked 2D image. Its `data_grid_slim` is a 2D grid where every
        (y,x) coordinate is aligned with the centre of every unmasked image pixel. A "lensing operation" transforms

        data_pixelization_grid
            The sparse set of (y,x) coordinates computed from the unmasked data in the `data` frame. This has a
            transformation applied to it to create the `source_pixelization_grid`.
        hyper_image
            An image which is used to determine the `data_pixelization_grid` and therefore adapt the distribution of
            pixels of the Delaunay grid to the data it discretizes.
        settings
            Settings controlling the pixelization for example if a border is used to relocate its exterior coordinates.
