        Packages together all derived data quantities necessary to fit `Imaging` data using an ` Inversion` via the
        w_tilde formalism.

        blurring operations performed using the imaging's PSF.

        Parameters
        ----------
        curvature_preload
            A matrix which uses the imaging's noise-map and PSF to preload as much of the computation of the
            curvature matrix as possible.
        indexes
            The image-pixel indexes of the curvature preload matrix, which are used to compute the curvature matrix
            efficiently when performing an inversion.
        lengths
            The lengths of how many indexes each curvature preload contains, again used to compute the curvature
            matrix efficienctly.
        noise_map_value
            The first value of the noise-map used to construct the curvature preload, which is used as a sanity
            check when performing the inversion to ensure the preload corresponds to the data being fitted.

        The lens dataset is the collection of data_type (image, noise-map, PSF), a mask, grid, convolver
        and other utilities that are used for modeling and fitting an image of a strong lens.

        Whilst the image, noise-map, etc. are loaded in 2D, the lens dataset creates reduced 1D arrays of each
        for lens calculations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid_class : ag.Grid2D
            The type of grid used to create the image from the `Galaxy` and `Plane`. The options are `Grid2D`,
            and `Grid2DIterate` (see the `Grid2D` documentation for a description of these options).
        grid_pixelized_class : ag.Grid2D
            The type of grid used to create the grid that maps the `LEq` source pixels to the data's image-pixels.
            The options are `Grid2D` and `Grid2DIterate`.
            (see the `Grid2D` documentation for a description of these options).
        sub_size
            If the grid and / or grid_pixelized use a `Grid2D`, this sets the sub-size used by the `Grid2D`.
        fractional_accuracy
            If the grid and / or grid_pixelized use a `Grid2DIterate`, this sets the fractional accuracy it
            uses when evaluating functions, where the fraction accuracy is the ratio of the values computed using
            two grids at a higher and lower sub-grid size.
        relative_accuracy
            If the grid and / or grid_pixelized use a `Grid2DIterate`, this sets the relative accuracy it
            uses when evaluating functions, where the relative accuracy is the absolute difference of the values
            computed using two grids at a higher and lower sub-grid size.
        sub_steps : [int]
            If the grid and / or grid_pixelized use a `Grid2DIterate`, this sets the steps the sub-size is increased by
            to meet the fractional accuracy when evaluating functions.
        signal_to_noise_limit
            If input, the dataset's noise-map is rescaled such that no pixel has a signal-to-noise above the
            signa to noise limit.
        psf_shape_2d
            The shape of the PSF used for convolving model image generated using analytic light profiles. A smaller
            shape will trim the PSF relative to the input image PSF, giving a faster analysis run-time.
