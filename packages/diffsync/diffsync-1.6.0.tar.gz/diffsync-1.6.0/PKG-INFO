# DiffSync

DiffSync is a utility library that can be used to compare and synchronize different datasets.

For example, it can be used to compare a list of devices from 2 inventory systems and, if required, synchronize them in either direction.

```python
A = DiffSyncSystemA()
B = DiffSyncSystemB()

A.load()
B.load()

# Show the difference between both systems, that is, what would change if we applied changes from System B to System A
diff_a_b = A.diff_from(B)
print(diff_a_b.str())

# Update System A to align with the current status of system B
A.sync_from(B)

# Update System B to align with the current status of system A
A.sync_to(B)
```
