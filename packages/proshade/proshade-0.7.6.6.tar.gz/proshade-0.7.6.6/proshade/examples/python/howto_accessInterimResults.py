#   \file howto_accessInterimResults.py
#   \brief This code demonstrates how interim results of internal ProSHADE computation can be accessed from python.
#
#   This file starts by reading in a mask from a file and creating a Fourier weights array as an array of ones. These
#   arrays are for demonstration purposes, but te user could obtain different arrays or obtain different arrays and
#   use such arrays instead.
#
#   Next, the settings object is created and set followed by the structure being read from file. The commented lines
#   show how the structure could be read if no mask, no weights or no arrays were required by the user. Note that the
#   arrays will be applied only if the input file format is density map (and will be ignored if the input file format
#   is co-ordinate). Also, the arrays are not required to have the same dimensions as the read in map, but it is strongly
#   recommended as the Fourier space re-sampling of input arrays may introduce artifacts that could cause extra issues
#   with the results.
#
#   Finally, the code shows how the spherical harmonics, normalised E-matrices, SO(3) coefficients and the (self-)rotation
#   function can be accessed.

### Accessing spherical harmonics
### =============================
###
### In order to access the spherical harmonics
### values for each sphere, please use the
### following functions:
###
### 1) getSphericalHarmonics()
###     This function returns a 2D numpy.ndarray of
###     complex numbers. This 2D array is organised so
###     that the first dimension is the sphere number
###     and the second dimension is a 1D array of all
###     the spherical harmonics values. This 1D array
###     is complicated by the fact that each sphere
###     can have different number of bands (depending
###     on the settings.progressiveSphereMapping value).
###     This means that some values for some spheres
###     are empty. Best way of accessing this array is
###     to use the second function.
###
### 2) findSHIndex()
###     This function takes the shell, band and order
###     values and returns the correct index for these
###     in the 1D array. Please note that the order
###     value needs to be in range -band <= order <= band
###     and NOT in the 0 <= order <= (2 * band) + 1.
###
sphericalHarmonics                                    = pStruct.getSphericalHarmonics ( )

shell =  3
band  =  4
order = -2
Shell3Band4OrderMin2Value                             = sphericalHarmonics[shell][pStruct.findSHIndex(shell, band, order)]
print                                                 ( Shell3Band4OrderMin2Value )
# Expected output: (-127.77624547146776+25.628635834474466j)

### Computing self-rotation function
### ================================
###
### This function computes the self-rotation
### function by firstly computing and normalising
### the E matrices, then combining these into
### the SO(3) coefficients and finally calcula-
### ting the inverse SO(3) Fourier Transform
### (SOFT) from them.
###
pStruct.computeRotationFunction                       ( pSet )

######################################################
### Accessing E Matrices
### ====================
###
### ProSHADE allows access to the weighted E matrices
### ( Integral _0 ^rMAX ( c1^lm * c2*^lm' ) of
### the structure combination. These are
### returned as a 3D Numpy array with indices being
### band of the E matrix, order1 of the E matrix
### and order2 of the E matrix. Note that because
### indices need to go from zero, the order of indexing
### goes like, for example, this:
###
### BAND = 2 || ORDER = -2  || INDEX [2][0]
### BAND = 2 || ORDER = -1  || INDEX [2][1]
### BAND = 2 || ORDER =  0  || INDEX [2][2]
### BAND = 2 || ORDER =  1  || INDEX [2][3]
### BAND = 2 || ORDER =  2  || INDEX [2][4]
### i.e. order index = ORDER + BAND
###
### NOTE: As Numpy arrays have single shape, the
### lower bands (which will have less orders)
### are padded with zeroes to have the same length
### as the largest band.
###
eMat                                                  = pStruct.getEMatrix ( )

Band4OrderOneMin2OrderTwo3EMatrixValue                = eMat[4][2][7] # Band = 4, Order1 = -2 and Order2 = 3

print ( Band4OrderOneMin2OrderTwo3EMatrixValue )
# Expected output: (6.779507998412581e-07+1.1580647039238433e-06j)

######################################################
### Accessing SO(3) coefficients
### ============================
###
### ProSHADE also allows access to the SO(3)
### coefficients computed by normalising the E
### matrix values and dealing with the signs.
### The inverse SO(3) Fourier Transform (SOFT)
### of these values then results in the rotation
### function. The complete complex array of
### these values can be accessed as shown.
###
### NOTE: Given that the SO(3) coefficients have the same
### indexing as the E matrices, ProSHADE provides them
### to the user in the same format as the E matrices.
### This does, however, mean that the same caveats do
### apply to the SO(3) coefficients array as did to the
### E matrix array.
###
so3Coeffs                                             = pStruct.getSO3Coefficients ( )


Band4OrderOneMin2OrderTwo3SO3CoeffsValue              = so3Coeffs[4][2][7] # Band = 4, Order1 = -2 and Order2 = 3

print ( Band4OrderOneMin2OrderTwo3SO3CoeffsValue )
# Expected output: (-2.0080373610170287e-06-3.430097276231109e-06j)

######################################################
### Accessing self-rotation function
### ================================
###
### ProSHADE also gives access to the self -
### rotation function as shown next. The returned 3D complex
### array has dimensions 2 * bandwidth. Please note that
### the indices have nothing to do with the angle values,
### if you want to know the Euler angle values for a
### particular index, you need to convert it
### yourself. Alternatively (and a recommended
### approach is), you can use the
### getRotationMatrixFromEulerIndices() function
### also demonstrated here.
###
selfRotationFunction                                  = pStruct.getRotationFunctionMap ( )

### Find the map maximum
rotMapMax                                             = numpy.where ( selfRotationFunction == numpy.amax ( selfRotationFunction ) )

### Find maximum value
print                                                 ( "Rotation map maximum is: " + str( selfRotationFunction[rotMapMax[0][0]][rotMapMax[1][0]][rotMapMax[2][0]] ) )

### Expected output: Rotation map maximum is: (0.9923989120515847-3.989699808661867e-17j)

### Find rotation matrix for the maximum (uses only the real parts, using magnitudes would be better)
rotMatMaxVal                                          = pStruct.getRotationMatrixFromSOFTCoordinates ( rotMapMax[0][0], rotMapMax[1][0], rotMapMax[2][0] )
print                                                 ( rotMatMaxVal )

### Expected output: [[ 1.00000000e+00  6.41847686e-16  0.00000000e+00]
### Expected output:  [-6.41847686e-16  1.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00]
### Expected output:  [-0.00000000e+00 -0.00000000e+00  1.00000000e+00]]
