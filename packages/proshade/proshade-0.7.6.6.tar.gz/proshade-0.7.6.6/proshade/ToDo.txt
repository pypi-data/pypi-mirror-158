To Do:

Testing:
* Look into the limits of structure overlay
* Make the Wigner D matrices accessible from python as well as their computation for various alpha, beta and gamma values
* Finish the translation function optimisation

Development
* Timing - are band and integration order correctly determined?
* Timing - can it be faster?
* Support non-orthogonal maps
* Change to NFFT and then change the sphere sampling for spherical harmonics, rotation function and angle-axis spheres to Fibonacci sampling.
* Create Homebrew/MacPorts build procedure for MacOS
* Create apt/zypper/yum build procedure for Linux
* Modify the code to use pragmas to include the Windows specific __declspec(dllexport) modifier to make the library usable on Windows.
* Add mmCIF output support.

Admin
* Get new version to CCP-EM including new interface
