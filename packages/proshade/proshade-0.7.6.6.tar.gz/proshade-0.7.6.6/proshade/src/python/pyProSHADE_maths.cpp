    \brief This file contains the PyBind11 bindings for selected ProSHADE_internal_maths namespace functions.
    
    This file provides the bindings for some selected ProSHADE_internal_maths namespace members and functions. These are useful for de-bugging,
    but they may not be directly useful to the user.
