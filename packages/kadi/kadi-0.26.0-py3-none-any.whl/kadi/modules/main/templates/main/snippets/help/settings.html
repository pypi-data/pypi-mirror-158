    Creating a personal access token (PAT) gives access to the HTTP API that Kadi4Mat provides. This API makes it
    possible to programmatically interact with most of the resources that can be managed via the graphical user
    interface of Kadi4Mat by sending suitable HTTP requests to the different endpoints the API provides. Detailed
    information about the API can be found in Kadi4Mat's
    <a href="{{ url_for('main.about') }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>documentation</strong></a>.
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-xl-2">Connected services</dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">
    In this menu, users can manage their connections with different third party services. Each service has to be
    registered as a plugin in the application and can be used for different tasks, e.g. publishing resources. Note that
    if no services are available in the current Kadi4Mat instance, this menu item is hidden.
