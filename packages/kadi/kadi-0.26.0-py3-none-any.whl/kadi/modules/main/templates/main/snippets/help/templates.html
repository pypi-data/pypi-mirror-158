  <strong>Templates</strong>
</h4>
<p>
  Templates enable the creation of blueprints for different resources. There are multiple types of templates, which
  define the actual content that a template can contain. The following types of templates currently exist:
</p>
<dl class="row">
  <dt class="col-xl-2">Record</dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">
    <em>Record</em> templates can contain most of the metadata that can be specified for a record, including its generic
    extra metadata, and can be selected when creating a new record.
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-xl-2">Extras</dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">
    <em>Extras</em> templates are focused on the generic extra metadata of a record. These kind of templates can be
    selected and combined wherever such metadata can be specified, including when creating other templates.
  </dd>
</dl>
<h5>Creating new templates</h5>
<p>
  Creating a new template is similar to creating other kinds of resources. Each template requires at least setting a
  title and identifier for the template itself, while the actual template data depends on the specific type of template.
</p>
<h5>Managing existing templates</h5>
<p>
  Similar to other resources, templates have their own navigation menu, offering different tabs for viewing and managing
  templates.
