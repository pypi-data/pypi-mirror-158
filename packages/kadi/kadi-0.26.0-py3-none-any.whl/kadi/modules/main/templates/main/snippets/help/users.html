  <strong>Users</strong>
</h4>
<p>
  In this view, all registered users of the current Kadi4Mat instance are shown. Clicking on a user leads to a separate
  page, which contains another navigation menu, providing access to different subpages. The respective contents of these
  pages are briefly described below.
</p>
<dl class="row">
  <dt class="col-xl-2">Profile</dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">
    On this page it is possible to see the basic information of a user, such as username and account type. Users are
    able to control some of the information shown on this page via the <a href="#settings"><strong>Settings</strong></a>
    menu.
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-xl-2">Resources</dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">
    This page shows all accessible resources that a specific user created. When looking at other users, resources that
    were (explicitly) shared with a user, either directly or via groups, are shown as well, including common groups.
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-xl-2">Trash</dt>
  <dd class="col-xl-10">
    This is where deleted resources can be found, namely deleted records, collections, templates or groups. Resources
    can either be restored or deleted permanently. The latter will also happen automatically after
    {{ config["RESOURCES_MAX_AGE"] | duration }}. Note that only the creator of a resource can restore or permanently
    delete it, which is why this menu is only shown for the own user.
