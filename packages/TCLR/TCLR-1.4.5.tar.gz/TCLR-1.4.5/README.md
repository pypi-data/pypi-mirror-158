# TCLR package 
TCLR, Version 1, October, 2021. 

Tree-Classifier for Linear Regression (TCLR) is a novel Machine learning model to capture the functional relationships between features and a target based on correlation.

Doi : http://dx.doi.org/10.20517/jmi.2022.04

Written using Python, which is suitable for operating systems, e.g., Windows/Linux/MAC OS etc.

## Installing 
    pip install TCLR 

## Updating 
    pip install --upgrade TCLR

## Running 

```
from TCLR import TCLRalgorithm as model
dataSet = "testdata.csv" # dataset name
correlation = 'PearsonR(+)'
minsize, threshold, mininc = 3, 0.9, 0.01
model.start(dataSet, correlation, minsize, threshold, mininc, gplearn = True)
```

output: 
+ classification structure tree in pdf formatï¼ˆResult of TCLR.pdf) 
+ a folder called 'Segmented' for saving the subdataset of each leaf (passed test) 

note: 

the complete execution template can be downloaded at the *Source Code* folder 

**graphviz** (recommended installation) package is needed for generating the graphical results, which can be downloaded from the official website http://www.graphviz.org/. see user guide.
