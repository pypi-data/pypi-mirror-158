# PyWebReport

Generate html reports by sources such as unittest、pytest and any more

like allure but as do-one-thing-do-it-well for **python community**.

## Current progress

- [x] Feasibility Study.(it seems feasible)
- [ ] Report designing 🚧👷(you can see progress [here](https://yongchin0821.github.io/pywebreport/))
- [ ] pytest adaptation 🚧👷 (about 50%)
- [ ] unittest adaptation

## My initial idea

We may extract results in different formats from pytest、unittest. if there have a formatter to format results into the
common datas,then we can use this datas to make html report.
