Dependencies
============

MicMec 1.0 has been developed with Python 3.7 and 3.8 in mind. 
It has been confirmed to work with the following combination of packages:

-   python      3.8.10
-   numpy       1.22.4
-   yaff        1.4.2
-   molmod      1.4.8
-   scipy       1.8.1
-   cython      0.29.30
-   matplotlib  3.5.2
-   h5py        3.7.0
-   jax         0.3.13 (optional)
-   jaxlib      0.3.10 (optional)
-   sphinx      5.0.2 (optional)
-   setuptools  63.0.1 (optional)

Sphinx is used for documentation, while JAX (with CUDA[CPU]) is used for automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation.
Sphinx and JAX are entirely optional and do not affect the core routines of MicMec. SetupTools is also optional.

Yaff is an important dependency, even though it only supplies one module to MicMec: ``yaff.pes.ext.Cell``. That is, however, a crucial module. 
For now, we have not been able to decouple ``yaff.pes.ext.Cell`` from Yaff.


``pip`` installation
====================

MicMec is part of the Python Package Index. Therefore, you can simply install it with ``pip``. 

.. code:: bash

   pip install micmec

Additional data and documentation can be found `here <https://github.com/Jlvdwall/micmec>`_.


Manual installation
===================

MicMec can be installed manually by cloning the entire GitHub repository into a pre-existing directory on your Python path, for instance, ``micmec_repo``.

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/Jlvdwall/micmec.git micmec_repo
   python

>>> import sys 
>>> repo = "micmec_repo"
>>> any((repo == directory[-len(repo):]) for directory in sys.path)

The Python code checks whether the repository directory (``micmec_repo`` in this case) is on your Python path. If it is not, you must add it to the path by editing your ``.bashrc`` or ``.profile`` script. With that, you can use MicMec to its fullest extent. As a bonus, you can install MicMec locally, by performing the following commands.

.. code:: bash

   cd micmec_repo
   python setup.py sdist
   pip list

That will create a source distribution and add MicMec to the list of installed packages.
