DxfStructure - structural engineering dxf drawing system
--------------------------------------------------------

DxfStructure is an structural engineering software that help making detailing drawing of steel and reinforced concrete structure. DxfStructure idea is based on DXF drawing format. DxfStrcture is a dxf file processor that analyze dxf file content and complete some additional data like mark and quantity of elements and material schedule.
DxfStructure is free software. All you need is any dxf file editor, it can be commercial software like AutoCad but also freeware like NanoCad or even free software like LibreCad.
