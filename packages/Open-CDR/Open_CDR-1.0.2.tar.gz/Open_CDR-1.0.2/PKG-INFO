# Open CDR Project
## overview
The CDR project is open-source solution for content disarm and reconstruction at Mailboxes. 
The CDR works by processing all incoming e-mails in a specific network, 
deconstructing them, and removing the elements that do not match the file type's standards or set policies. 
CDR technology then rebuilds the e-mail into clean versions that can be sent on to end users as intended.
