## Contributing

Clone the repo.

```
git clone git@github.com:ConductorTechnologies/ciohoudini.git
cd ciohoudini
```

Set up a clean virtual envirionment with Python 2.7 for development (optional).

```
python -m virtualenv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
```

Install development dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

Build and install from this directory into to a convenient location for testing.
```

pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt --target=$HOME/ConductorDev

python $HOME/ConductorDev/ciohoudini/post_install.py
```

When you install from the file requirements.txt, the dependency on ciocore is specified as a local sibling of this project, meaning you can develop ciocore and ciohoudini in parallel.

The post_install.py script writes the conductor.json file to the packages directory in your Houdini prefs. Check the output of the command to see where this is for your platform.
