Make sure you have `python3.10` installed. You can download and install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/\n2. Clone the repo and `cd` into it\n3. Install `pygame` by running `pip install pygame` to install it globally, or create a python `venv`<sup>[1]</sup> and install it there\n4. If you're using a `venv`, activate it and then run `python3 src/main.py`\n\n[1] Create a `venv` by running `python3 -m venv venv`\n\n### Configuring Game Settings\nAll the configurable settings are stored in the `settings/settings.json` file in the game folder.<br>\nSince the current version of `PIXELJUMP` does not support in-game settings configuration yet, the only way to adjust the game settings is to edit the `settings.json` file.\n#### Screen Resolution\nThe game is in `1920x1080` by default as it was the resolution we had in mind when designing the game but you can change it to your liking.<br>\nThe screen resolution of the game can be changed by adjusting the `screen_width` and `screen_height` keys in `settings.json`\n#### FPS\nIt is not reccomended to change the FPS as it may cause some unwanted behaviours\n#### Player velocity and gravity\nFeel free to mess around with the velocity and gravity of the player :smile:\n\n\n### Project Poster\n![project_poster](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1aqh3d5f08MciOXuNbmsdHS0T8P3vGBgA)\n",
