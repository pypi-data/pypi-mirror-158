"Apache Log4j2 <=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, "
"and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other "
"JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log "
"message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when "
"message lookup substitution is enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. In previous "
"releases (>2.10) this behavior can be mitigated by setting system property "
"\"log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups\" to \"true\" or it can be mitigated in prior "
"releases (<2.10) by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath "
"(example: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/"
"JndiLookup.class)."
msgstr ""

msgid "HTTP Methods"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While GET and POST are by far the most common methods that are used to "
"access information provided by a web server, HTTP allows several other (and "
"somewhat less known) methods."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some of these can be used for nefarious purposes if the web server is "
"misconfigured."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unvalidated redirects and forwards are possible when a web application "
"accepts untrusted input that could cause the web application to redirect the "
"request to a URL contained within untrusted input."

"By modifying untrusted URL input to a malicious site, an attacker may "
"successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Reflected Cross Site Scripting"
msgstr ""

msgid "XSS"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability "
"typically found in web applications which allow code injection by malicious "
"web users into the web pages viewed by other users."
msgstr ""

msgid "Examples of such code include HTML code and client-side scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The best way to protect a web application from XSS attacks is ensure that "
"the application performs validation of all headers, cookies, query strings, "
"form fields, and hidden fields."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Encoding user supplied output in the server side can also defeat XSS "
"vulnerabilities by preventing inserted scripts from being transmitted to "
"users in an executable form."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Applications can gain significant protection from javascript based attacks "
"by converting the following characters in all generated output to the "
"appropriate HTML entity encoding:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Resource consumption"

msgid "It took an abnormal time to the server to respond to a query."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An attacker might leverage this kind of weakness to overload the server."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The involved script is maybe using the server resources (CPU, memory, "
"network, file access...) in a non-efficient way."
msgstr ""

msgid "Secure Flag cookie"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The secure flag is an option that can be set by the application server when "
"sending a new cookie to the user within an HTTP Response."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The purpose of the secure flag is to prevent cookies from being observed by "
"unauthorized parties due to the transmission of a the cookie in clear text."
msgstr ""

msgid "When generating the cookie, make sure to set the Secure Flag to True."
msgstr ""

msgid "SQLI"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"SQL injection vulnerabilities allow an attacker to alter the queries "
"executed on the backend database."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An attacker may then be able to extract or modify information stored in the "
"database or even escalate his privileges on the system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Blind SQL injection is a technique that exploits a vulnerability occurring "
"in the database of an application."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This kind of vulnerability is harder to detect than basic SQL injections "
"because no error message will be displayed on the webpage."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To protect against SQL injection, user input must not directly be embedded "
"in SQL statements."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead, user input must be escaped or filtered or parameterized statements "
"must be used."
msgstr ""

msgid "TLS/SSL misconfigurations"
msgstr ""

msgid "SSL misconfigurations"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The TLS protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity "
"between two or more communicating computer applications."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Over the years numerous vulnerabilities have been discovered in some SSL/TLS "
"version or specific ciphers making the integrity of the communications at "
"risk (eavesdropping, alteration...)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To protect against SSL/TLS vulnerabilities make sure that deprecated "
"versions of the protocol are disabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Refer to up-to-date recommendations to only allow modern versions of TLS "
"with Perfect Forward Secrecy."

"tampered with."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Every URI received by the web application should be checked, especially "

msgid "Subdomain takeover"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A DNS CNAME record points to a non existing domain or to a content that an "

msgid "XML External Entity"
msgstr ""

msgid "XXE"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An XML External Entity attack is a type of attack against an application "
"that parses XML input."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external "
"entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of "
"service, server side request forgery, port scanning from the perspective of "
"the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts."
msgstr ""

"The safest way to prevent XXE is always to disable DTDs (External Entities) "
