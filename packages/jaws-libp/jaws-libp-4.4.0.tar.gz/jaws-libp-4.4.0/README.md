## Install
Requires [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/)

```
pip install jaws-libp
```

**Note**: Using newer versions of Python may be problematic because the depenency `confluent-kafka` uses librdkafka, which often does not have a wheel file prepared for later versions of Python, meaning setuptools will attempt to compile it for you, and that often doesn't work (especially on Windows).   Python 3.9 DOES have a wheel file for confluent-kafka so that's your safest bet. 

## API
[Sphinx Docs](https://jeffersonlab.github.io/jaws-libp/)

## Build
This [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/) project is built with [setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/setuptools.html) and may be run using the Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) feature to isolate dependencies.   The [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) tool can be used to download dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libp
cd jaws-libp
python -m build
```
