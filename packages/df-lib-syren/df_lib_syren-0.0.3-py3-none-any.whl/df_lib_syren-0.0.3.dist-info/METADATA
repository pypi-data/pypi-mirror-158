## What is this  about?
Imagine you want to compare various iterations of a table or data file. You may need to ensure that your versions of a 
list that is maintained by more than one person or system are same. When you have to solve this manually, it is 
difficult. So, let's make use of this library right now!

## How does it work?
The script takes the ID value of an entry from the first table, searches for it in the second table, and sees 
if it can find it there. If it does not, it will list this entry as a table 1 entry that was not found in table 2. 
This will occur in the opposite direction for table 2 versus table 1. Furthermore, the script compares the values of 
entries with the same ID and, if they differ, lists the differences.

## What does it require?
Each table entry must have a unique identifier, also known as a key value. 
This could be an order number or an employee number, for example, but it could 
also be any other characters as long as it is unique to an entry. This key value 
must be located in your table's first column. The order of the other columns, 
and also the overall order of the rows, is completely irrelevant. 
we hope this library saves you some time!
