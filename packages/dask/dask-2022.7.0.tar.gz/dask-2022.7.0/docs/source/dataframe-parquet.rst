Dask Dataframe and Parquet
==========================

.. currentmodule:: dask.dataframe

Parquet_ is a popular, columnar file format designed for efficient data storage
and retrieval. Dask dataframe includes :func:`read_parquet` and
:func:`to_parquet` functions/methods for reading and writing parquet files
respectively. Here we document these methods, and provide some tips and best
practices.

Reading Parquet Files
---------------------

.. autosummary::
    read_parquet

Dask dataframe provides a :func:`read_parquet` function for reading one or more
parquet files. Its first argument is one of:

- A path to a single parquet file
- A path to a directory of parquet files (files with ``.parquet`` or ``.parq`` extension)
- A `glob string`_ expanding to one or more parquet file paths
- A list of parquet file paths

These paths can be local, or point to some remote filesystem (for example S3_
or GCS_) by prepending the path with a protocol.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import dask.dataframe as dd

    # Load a single local parquet file
    >>> df = dd.read_parquet("path/to/mydata.parquet")

    # Load a directory of local parquet files
    >>> df = dd.read_parquet("path/to/my/parquet/")

    # Load a directory of parquet files from S3
    >>> df = dd.read_parquet("s3://bucket-name/my/parquet/")

Note that for remote filesystems you may need to configure credentials. When
possible we recommend handling these external to Dask through
filesystem-specific configuration files/environment variables. For example, you
may wish to store S3 credentials using the `AWS credentials file`_.
Alternatively, you can pass configuration on to the fsspec_ backend through the
``storage_options`` keyword argument:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> df = dd.read_parquet(
   ...      "s3://bucket-name/my/parquet/",
   ...      storage_options={"anon": True}  # passed to `s3fs.S3FileSystem`
   ... )

For more information on connecting to remote data, see
:doc:`how-to/connect-to-remote-data`.

:func:`read_parquet` has many configuration options affecting both behavior and
performance. Here we highlight a few common options.

Engine
~~~~~~

:func:`read_parquet` supports two backend engines - ``pyarrow`` and
``fastparquet``. The ``pyarrow`` engine is used by default, falling back to
``fastparquet`` if ``pyarrow`` isn't installed. If desired, you may explicitly
specify the engine using the ``engine`` keyword argument:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> df = dd.read_parquet(
   ...      "s3://bucket-name/my/parquet/",
   ...      engine="fastparquet"  # explicitly specify the fastparquet engine
   ... )

Metadata
~~~~~~~~

When :func:`read_parquet` is used to read *multiple files*, it first loads
metadata about the files in the dataset. This metadata may include:

- The dataset schema
- How the dataset is partitioned into files, and those files into row-groups

Some parquet datasets include a ``_metadata`` file which aggregates per-file
metadata into a single location. For small-to-medium sized datasets this *may*
be useful because it makes accessing the row-group metadata possible without
reading parts of *every* file in the dataset. Row-group metadata allows Dask to
split large files into smaller in-memory partitions, and merge many small files
into larger partitions, possibly leading to higher performance.

However, for large datasets the ``_metadata`` file can be problematic because
it may be too large for a single endpoint to parse! If this is true, you can
disable loading the ``_metadata`` file by specifying
``ignore_metadata_file=True``.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> df = dd.read_parquet(
   ...      "s3://bucket-name/my/parquet/",
   ...      ignore_metadata_file=True  # don't read the _metadata file
   ... )

Partition Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Dask will load each parquet file individually as a partition in
the Dask dataframe. This is performant provided all files are of reasonable size.

We recommend aiming for 10-250 MiB in-memory size per file once loaded into
pandas. Too large files can lead to excessive memory usage on a single worker,
while too small files can lead to poor performance as the overhead of Dask
dominates. If you need to read a parquet dataset composed of large files,
you can pass ``split_row_groups=True`` to have Dask partition your data by
*row group* instead of by *file*. Note that this approach will not scale as
well as ``split_row_groups=False`` without a global ``_metadata`` file,
because the footer will need to be loaded from every file in the dataset.

Column Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When loading parquet data, sometimes you don't need all the columns available
in the dataset. In this case, you likely want to specify the subset of columns
you need via the ``columns`` keyword argument. This is beneficial for a few
reasons:

- It lets Dask read less data from the backing filesystem, reducing IO costs
- It lets Dask load less data into memory, reducing memory usage

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dd.read_parquet(
    ...     "s3://path/to/myparquet/",
    ...     columns=["a", "b", "c"]  # Only read columns 'a', 'b', and 'c'
    ... )

Calculating Divisions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, :func:`read_parquet` will **not** produce a collection with
known divisions. However, you can pass ``calculate_divisions=True`` to
tell Dask that you want to use row-group statistics from the footer
metadata (or global ``_metadata`` file) to calculate the divisions at
graph-creation time. Using this option will not produce known
divisions if any of the necessary row-group statistics are missing,
or if no index column is detected. Using the ``index`` argument is the
best way to ensure that the desired field will be treated as the index.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dd.read_parquet(
    ...     "s3://path/to/myparquet/",
    ...     index="timestamp",  # Specify a specific index column
    ...     calculate_divisions=True,  # Calculate divisions from metadata
    ... )

Although using ``calculate_divisions=True`` does not require any *real*
data to be read from the parquet file(s), it does require Dask to load
and process metadata for every row-group in the dataset. For this reason,
calculating divisions should be avoided for large datasets without a
global ``_metadata`` file. This is especially true for remote storage.

For more information about divisions, see :ref:`dataframe.design`.

Writing
-------

.. autosummary::
    to_parquet
    DataFrame.to_parquet

Dask dataframe provides a :func:`to_parquet` function and method for writing
parquet files.

In its simplest usage, this takes a path to the directory in which to write the
dataset. This path may be local, or point to some remote filesystem (for
example S3_ or GCS_) by prepending the path with a protocol.

.. code-block:: python

    # Write to a local directory
    >>> df.to_parquet("path/to/my/parquet/")

    # Write to S3
    >>> df.to_parquet("s3://bucket-name/my/parquet/")

Note that for remote filesystems you may need to configure credentials. When
possible we recommend handling these external to Dask through
filesystem-specific configuration files/environment variables For example, you
may wish to store S3 credentials using the `AWS credentials file`_.
Alternatively, you can pass configuration on to the fsspec_ backend through the
``storage_options`` keyword argument:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> df.to_parquet(
   ...     "s3://bucket-name/my/parquet/",
   ...     storage_options={"anon": True}  # passed to `s3fs.S3FileSystem`
   ... )

For more information on connecting to remote data, see
:doc:`how-to/connect-to-remote-data`.

Dask will write one file per Dask dataframe partition to this directory. To
optimize access for downstream consumers, we recommend aiming for an in-memory
size of 10-250 MiB per partition. This helps balance worker memory usage
against Dask overhead. You may find the
:meth:`DataFrame.memory_usage_per_partition` method useful for determining if
your data is partitioned optimally.

:func:`to_parquet` has many configuration options affecting both behavior and
performance. Here we highlight a few common options.

Engine
~~~~~~

:func:`to_parquet` supports two backend engines - ``pyarrow`` and
``fastparquet``. The ``pyarrow`` engine is used by default, falling back to
``fastparquet`` if ``pyarrow`` isn't installed. If desired, you may explicitly
specify the engine using the ``engine`` keyword argument:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> df.to_parquet(
   ...      "s3://bucket-name/my/parquet/",
   ...      engine="fastparquet"  # explicitly specify the fastparquet engine
   ... )

Metadata
~~~~~~~~

In order to improve *read* performance, Dask can optionally write out
a global ``_metadata`` file at write time by aggregating the row-group
metadata from every file in the dataset. While potentially useful at
read time, the generation of this file may result in excessive memory
usage at scale (and potentially killed Dask workers). As such,
enabling the writing of this file is only recommended for small to
moderate dataset sizes.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> df.to_parquet(
   ...     "s3://bucket-name/my/parquet/",
   ...     write_metadata_file=True  # enable writing the _metadata file
   ... )

File Names
~~~~~~~~~~

:func:`to_parquet` will write one file per Dask dataframe partition to the
output directory. By default these files will have names like
``part.0.parquet``, ``part.1.parquet``, etc. If you wish to alter this naming
scheme, you can use the ``name_function`` keyword argument. This takes a
function with the signature ``name_function(partition: int) -> str``, taking
the partition index for each Dask dataframe partition and returning a string to
use as the filename. Note that names returned must sort in the same order as
their partition indices.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> df.npartitions  # 3 partitions (0, 1, and 2)
    3

    >>> df.to_parquet("/path/to/output", name_function=lambda i: f"data-{i}.parquet")

    >>> os.listdir("/path/to/parquet")
    ["data-0.parquet", "data-1.parquet", "data-2.parquet"]
