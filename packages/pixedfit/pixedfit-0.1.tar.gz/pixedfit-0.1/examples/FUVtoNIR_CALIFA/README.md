# Example of FUV-NIR images + CALIFA IFS data analysis with piXedfit

In this tutorial, we will use piXedfit for analyzing spatially resolved spectrophotometric SEDs of a local galaxy NGC 309. We will combine 12-bands imaging data from GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE, and intergal field spectroscopy (IFS) data from the CALIFA survey. To run the jupyter notebooks files, you will need to download the data from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14ZhcUTcwFFHBh9zaP8p3WEMlNbf5804L?usp=sharing).
