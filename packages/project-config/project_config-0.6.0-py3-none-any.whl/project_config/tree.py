@dataclass
class Tree:
    """Files cache used by the linter in checking processes.

    It represents the tree of files and directories starting
    at the root directory of the project.

    Instances of :py:class:`project_config.tree.Tree` can be
    iterated with:

    .. code-block:: python

       for fpath, fcontent in tree.files:
           if fcontent is None:
                # file does not exist
                ...
           elif not isinstance(fcontent, str):
                # file is a directory
                #
                # so `fcontent` is another Tree instance here
                for nested_fpath, nested_fcontent in fcontent.files:
                    ...

    If you want to get the serialialized version of the file you can
    use the method :py:meth:`project_config.tree.Tree.serialize_file`:

    .. code-block:: python

       instance = fpath, tree.serialize_file(fpath)

    If you are not inside a context were you have the content
    of the files (a common scenario for conditional actions)
    you can get them calling the method
    :py:meth:`project_config.tree.Tree.get_file_content`:

    .. code-block:: python

       fcontent = tree.get_file_content(fpath)

    This class caches the files contents along with their
    serialized versions, so subsequent access to the same
    files in the project tree are fast.
