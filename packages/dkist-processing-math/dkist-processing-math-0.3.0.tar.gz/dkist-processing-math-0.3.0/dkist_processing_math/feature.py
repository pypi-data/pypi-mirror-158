    """
    Find the most significant angles in a Hough transform.

    Peaks in the Hough transform are first found with a simple max filter and then refined via interpolation of the
    surrounding peak.

    Note, peak angles are not allowed to be within pi/10 of each other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hough_accumulator
        A 2D array representing a Hough accumulator

    theta
        A 1D array of the angle values corresponding to hough_accumulator

    Returns
    -------
    peak_theta
        The most significant angles found

    idx
        The index values corresponding to the location in theta of the initial (non-interpolated) guesses for most
        significant angles.
