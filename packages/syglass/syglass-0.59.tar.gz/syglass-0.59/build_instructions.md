## Building the Python Module
To build syGlass' Python module, you'll need to do the following from the repositories base directory `syGlass`:
- Make sure you have [Python3 64-bit](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.4/python-3.7.4-amd64.exe)
- Run `generate.py`
- Run `setup.py`
- Build `libpyGlass` in the **Retail** configuration
- Run `buildPyglass.py`

## Building the Documentation
Note: you will need Sphinx installed. Run
```
pip install sphinx
```
To build the Sphinx documentation for the syGlass Python module, simply run the batch file in this directory with the argument `html`:
```
$ make.bat html
```
The documentation will be generated in `syGlass/pyglass/build`. Open the file `index.html` there to check out the results.

## Publishing Updates to PyPI
To publish an update, first adjust the version number in the script `setup.py` found in this directory. Then execute the following commands from this directory, changing the name of the `zip` file in the second command according to the new version number:
```
$ python setup.py sdist
$ python -m twine upload dist/syglass-[version].tar.gz
```
You will need to have `twine` installed to do this. It can be installed via `pip`. You will also be prompted for PyPI credentials.

## Updating Documentation for the Web
To update the documents, clone or pull the latest version of the master branch of the [istovisio.github.io repo](https://github.com/IstoVisio/istovisio.github.io).
Replace the existing files with the newly generated Sphinx html documentation, and commit/push.

## Installing the Python Module
To install, simply:
```
$ pip install syglass 
```
Upgrading an existing installation is similar:
```
$ pip install syglass --upgrade
```
Once that's done, you can `import syglass` from Python and use it accordingly.
