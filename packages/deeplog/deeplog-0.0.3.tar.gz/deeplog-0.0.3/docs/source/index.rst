Welcome to DeepLog's documentation!
===================================

DeepLog provides a pytorch implementation of `Deeplog: Anomaly detection and diagnosis from system logs through deep learning`_.
This code was implemented as part of the IEEE S&P 2022 `DeepCASE: Semi-Supervised Contextual Analysis of Security Events`_ paper.
We ask people to cite both works when using the software for academic research papers, see :ref:`Citing` for more information.
