Some other ships will come from the left

Just skip them

Easiest way to install is from you system console:  
	`pip install skipperz`

then run with this command:  
	`python -m skipperz`


controls
----
Curently, you can only use the keyboard directional arrows.

Well... actually, you can try to edit `params.py` directly on your drive. It is somewhat technical, but nothing crazy.

I will add other methods later (touchscreen, mouse, joypad)

You do whatever you want with this. I take no responsability if it backfires.
