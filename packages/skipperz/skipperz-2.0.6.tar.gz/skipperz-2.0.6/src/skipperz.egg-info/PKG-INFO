In this game, you control a spaceship initially at the right side of the screen.

Some other ships will come from the left

Just skip them

Easiest way to install is from you system console:  
	`pip install skipperz`

then run with this command:  
	`python -m skipperz`


controls
----
Curently, you can only use the keyboard directional arrows.

Well... actually, you can try to edit `params.py` directly on your drive. It is somewhat technical, but nothing crazy.

I will add other methods later (touchscreen, mouse, joypad)
