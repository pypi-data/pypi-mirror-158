Kubify OS, Version: 9002.0.2

Well hello there! Welcome to Kubify. The Turn-Key MLOps Stack.

Who is this for?
================

Data Scientists/Devs/DevOps who want self service.

To rapid develop many services/models fast simultaneously on full real
environment.

Why?
====

Because Docker-Compose and Terraform are 2 different tools, so I fixed
it.

First class rapid testing, all your services listening for folder
changes, so you can code fast, really fast.

If it works on your laptop, it works in prod.

How?
