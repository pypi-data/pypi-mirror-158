Description: Welcome!
        ========
        
        Kubify OS, Version: 9003.1.0
        
        Well hello there! Welcome to Kubify. The Turn-Key DevOps/MLOps OS Developer-First Stack.
        
        Who is this for?
        ================
        
        Data Scientists/Devs/DevOps who want self service.
        
        To rapid develop many services/models fast simultaneously on full real
        environment.
        
        Why?
        ====
        
        Because Docker-Compose and Terraform are 2 different tools, so I fixed
        it.
        
        First class rapid testing, all your services listening for folder
        changes, so you can code fast, really fast.
        
        If it works on your laptop, it works in prod.
        
        How?

        To use the python package
        =========================
        
        You can ``import kubify`` (we ship to PyPi), and then you can override
        any folder (such as terraform or services folders) by having folder with
        the same name in your repo.
        
        See ``./examples/simple`` for Python Package usage example.
        
        To run this repo directly
        =========================
        
        To contribute to Kubify Open Source (and I hope you do), then clone this
        repo and:
        
        1. ``make cloud cloud=[aws|gcp|azure]``
        2. ``make local``
        3. ``make local start-all``
        4. ``make local [service]``
        
        All the dependant services will start and will listen for code changes
        as well. Efficiently edit the entire codebase.
        
        To install directly on workstation
        ==================================
        
        To install directly on your workstation (instead of just using the
        container):
        
        1. apple: ``make mac``
        2. ubuntu, debian and other debian-based: ``make deb``
        3. rhel, centos and other epel-based: ``make epel``
        
        Environment Isolation
        =====================
        
        Security Minute: You should not give prod access to anyone (but devs
        need to debug urgent issue in prod). How?
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           cd services/example-node-complex-svc
           make local prod
        
        What Just Happened?
        ===================
        
        You are hot patching many services locally (and with the full real
        environment) without access to data, but with the full real prod!
        Kubernetes can be amazing, and it is, with Kubify..
