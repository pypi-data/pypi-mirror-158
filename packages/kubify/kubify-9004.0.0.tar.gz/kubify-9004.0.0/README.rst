Welcome!

Kubify OS, Version: 9004.0.0

Well hello there! Welcome to Kubify. The Turn-Key DevOps/MLOps OS Developer-First Stack.

Who is this for?
================

Data Scientists/Devs/DevOps who want self service.

To rapid develop many services/models fast simultaneously on full real
environment.

Why?
====

Because Docker-Compose and Terraform are 2 different tools, so I fixed
it.

First class rapid testing, all your services listening for folder
changes, so you can code fast, really fast.

If it works on your laptop, it works in prod.

How?
====

DevEx First Class Ideology

Magic? Yes. Pure Magic.

This is a python package and a docker image (multi-arch).

1. PyPi
2. DockerHub


Cloud:

1. `make clouds`

You have a redundant cloud!


Usage of published PyPi "kubify" package in your repo:

1. `pip install kubify`
2. optional services and/or terraform folders (default it uses the ones in this repo)
3. `kubify start-all` or `kubify start service []` for rapid code development (all services listening for code changes on real environment)

Enjoy Rapid Testing!


Contributing:

(choose any to contribute to the kubify python package in this repo)
A. devcontainer or container
B. `tox`
C. `make docker`
D. `make pip`
E. `make pythons`
F. `make test`
G. and more ..

Happy Coding!


Who are you?
============

I have a ton of MLOps and DevOps experience. I want to build an open source turn-key MLOps/DevOps stack, developer-first, self-service and redunant, as well as lowest cost (arm/spot) and scalable.

I am looking for contributors to build Kubify OS into a full-force turn-key DevEx solution.


Please contribute!
==================

We all want self service turn key. It has arrived. No more K8s pains.
Please contribute.

TODO: Implement DR Automation
=============================

Everything you build in Kubify has redundancy (dr, backups and active-active) and scalability in 2 regions, at the lowest possible cost (multiarch, spot, atom processor, spot gpu rapid de-scaling, mlops smart scaling, redundant scalers and more).

This is what true turn key feels like. DevOps in 1 day. Developer friendly. Purpose built for Data Scientists and Machine Learning, as well as Developers building services and cloud. Autopilot for DevOps, so your DevOps team can focus on company goals.
