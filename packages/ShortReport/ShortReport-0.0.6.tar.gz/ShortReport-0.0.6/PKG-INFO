- **Numbers and Types**: Shows the number of columns and rows present in the dataset. Also describe the type of columns.
- **Essentials**: Unique values in a column and Numbers of missing values
- **Descriptive statistics**: Mean and Standard Deviation.
- **Graphs**: Short Report includes different plotly graphs for better visualization like Histograms for data distribution of each column, Scatter Plot for finding the relationships or pattern between the attributes or columns, Heat Map for finding the correlation with target variable and Boxplot for outlier detection.
- **Data Summary**: includes Numbers of zeros and percentage, Maximum and Minimum value.

### Advantages:
- ***User Friendly***: This Library helps user to understand the nature of data easily in very efficient way.
- ***Graphs***: All graphs are made from plotly so user can interact with the graph values.
- ***Fast***: Generates report in milliseconds.
