## Overview

OpenDelta is a toolkit for parameter efficient methods (we dub it as *delta tuning*), by which users could flexibly assign (or add) a small amount parameters to update while keeping the most paramters frozen. By using OpenDelta, users could easily implement prefix-tuning, adapters, Lora, or any other types of delta tuning with preferred PTMs.

- Our repo is tested on Python 3.8 and PyTorch 1.9.0. Lower version may also be supported. 

- **A demo of using Opendelta to modify the PLM (E.g., BART).**

## Updates
- 2022.03.24 We notice several bugs in Soft Prompt Tuning and Prefix Tuning, mainly due to their need to customize attention ids, token_type_ids, we are fixing it! Currently, please use the other methods since they are stabler and better in performance. 
- 2022.03.20 Add a [colab example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hM_zu11s6plpK-YQSkz3CrowJyxtHneY?usp=sharing) to illustrate efficient training and space-saving multitask-serving.
- 2022.03.20 A new pip version released.
- 2022.02.16 Support [regular expression](https://opendelta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/namebasedaddr.html#regexexpr) in named-based addressing. 

## Installation
create a virtualenv (optional)
```shell
conda create -n opendelta_env python=3.8
conda activate opendelta_env
```

### Using Pip



Install OpenDelta using pip as follows:
```shell
pip install opendelta
```

To play with the latest features, you can also install OpenDelta from the source.

### Build from Source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/thunlp/OpenDelta.git
cd OpenDelta
``` 

#### Option 1: If you won't modify the code, run
```shell
python setup.py install
```

#### Option 2:  If you want to modify the code or keep the repo updated by git clone, run
```shell
python setup.py develop
```

If you encounter network error using setup.py, please firstly install the dependencies via
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt && python setup.py develop
```

## Must Try

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM
t5 = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("t5-base")
from opendelta import AutoDeltaModel
delta = AutoDeltaModel.from_finetuned("DeltaHub/lora_t5-base_mrpc", backbone_model=t5)
delta.log()
```

## Verified Supported Models

- **You can try to use OpenDelta on *any* backbone models based on PyTorch.**  
- However, with small chances thatThe interface of the submodules of the backbone model is not supported. Therefore we verified some commonly
used models that OpenDelta are sure to support.

- We will keep testing more and more emerging models.

- Pull requests are welcomed when you successfully apply OpenDelta on your own backbone model.
