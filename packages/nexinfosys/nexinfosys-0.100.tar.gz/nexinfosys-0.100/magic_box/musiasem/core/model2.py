Model for MuSIASEM

Elements
* Case studies
* Processors
* Observations on Processors or sets of Processors
* Factors (flows and funds), which are Observations
* Hierarchies. Can be typologies "is-a" or structural "part-of"
* Links between factors (of the same type).

Use cases
* Processors containing flows and funds (flow or fund are "factor")
* Factors can be extensive or intensive. To express an intensive, in the observation put the factor to which the relation can be transformed into extensive
* Factors can be observed by different Observers 
* Allow several observations (pair Observable-Observer).
  * Clear separation of top-down and bottom-up (how?)
    * Top-down can be directly specified
    * Bottom-up is an expression.
* Observations of factors can be deterministic or probabilistic (NUSAP)
  * It can be an expression (a template processor)
* The observation has a provenance specified by the Observer
* There are KPI's (like Bioeconomic Pressure)
* Processors can be TYPES (aggregating real processors according to some criteria) or REAL (specific processor, that can also be the expression of a function -virtual-)
* Processors can contain other processors as specializations and/or part-of
* Processors can be extensive or intensive if all its factors are such
* Losses. Either a structural processor with no output, or an input to "Eco" processor to accumulate
* Processors are linked to other processors
  * Same level
  * Parent-child
  * NO distinction between same level and parent-child connections
* Factors can contain other factors as "is-a"
* Factor hierarchies. There can exist transformations between factor hierarchies
* Allow building MuSIASEM case studies in multiple steps. For instance, upscaling
* Observations (factors and KPIs) can have zero or more benchmarks
* Link factors
  * How to represent a bundle of links?? Expression?? Wildcard?? (like "all factors which are leaf nodes in the typology T")
* Factors by default inherit the hierarchies of the Processors in which they are embedded
  * Parent-child links created by default
  * Lateral links can change the previous
 
Case studies
* Almer√≠a. Upscaling of intensive processors. Conversion to extensive
* Soslaires. All extensive processors related both hierarchically and sequentially
* Energy (Maddalena). Tree structure of Processors
* Michele Food case study.
