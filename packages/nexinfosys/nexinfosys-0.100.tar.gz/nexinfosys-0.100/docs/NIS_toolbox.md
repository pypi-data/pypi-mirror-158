# NIS Toolbox

NIS (Nexus Information System) Toolbox is a software ecosystem developed inside MAGIC project (<a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/689669">H2020 grant #689669</a>). 

It was designed to enable "accounting the biophysical flows in complex bioeconomic systems" according to MuSIASEM concepts and methodology, as a way to assess the sustainability of current -or future- scenarios in socio-ecologic systems.

NIS Toolbox is made of four main components:

* **nis-backend** is the module in charge of processing MAGIC models (a format created during the project) via a suitable interface: it is programmatically actionable via a [RESTful API](restful_api.md), ([live](https://one.nis.magic-nexus.eu/nis_api/sources/-/databases/-) example -list of all available external datasets-), or the **nis-client**; or through the experimental graphical user interface **nis-frontend**).
* **nis-frontend** ([live](https://one.nis.magic-nexus.eu/nis_client/)) is a web application encompassing the different steps of the analysis, from the specification of the model to the management of results.  
* **nis-client**, can be used from scripts written in Python ([usage example](https://github.com/MAGIC-nexus/nis-python-client/blob/develop/nexinfosys/basic_usage2.py)) or R ([example usage](https://github.com/MAGIC-nexus/nis-python-client/blob/develop/nexinfosys/basic_usage.R)) languages.  
* **nis-eda** ([live](https://aware.nis.magic-nexus.eu/nis-eda/)) is an exploratory data analysis tool written in R and Shiny which processes analysis outputs (or connects to an instance of **nis-backend** to directly obtain the outputs to be explored).

Source code is open and published in Github, under "[MAGIC-nexus H2020](https://github.com/MAGIC-nexus)" organization. Non-publishable code (due to integration of third party commercial components) can be requested to the contact person (see [Social](social.md)).

NIS Toolbox is **open** also in the sense that it can be used to integrate MuSIASEM in reproducible analytic/scientific workflows.
