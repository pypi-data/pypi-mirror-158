Yet Another Github Label Synchroniser.

## Inspiration
I wanted to be good at labeling at GitHub. Therefore, for reference, I searched for well-labeled repositories.

However, it was hard work to carry the labels of the repository on a single way. I looked up Github Label Synchroniser to find some efficient way, but I didn't like they.

That's why I made the Yet Another Github Label Synchronizer.

## Feather
* Copy and paste labels from the repository
* Save token
* Automatically navigate through repositories with only the name of the repository
