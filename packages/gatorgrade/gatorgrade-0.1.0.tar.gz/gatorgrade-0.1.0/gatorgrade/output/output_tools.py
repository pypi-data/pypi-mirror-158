"""
This file is used for storing supporting functions and tools.

These functions and tools are used by the methods in output_functions.
The main use of this class is to de-clutter output_functions.py for
better readability. One example of a function to be written here is
the splitting of strings retrieved from the input team, at spaces, into
lists.
