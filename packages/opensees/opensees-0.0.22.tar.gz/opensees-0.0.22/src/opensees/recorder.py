class Node:
    """
    Record the response of a number of nodes at every converged step.

    RETURNS

    >0 an integer tag that can be used as a handle on the recorder for the remove recorder commmand.

    -1 recorder command failed if integer -1 returned.


    NOTES

    - Only one of -file, -xml, -binary, -tcp will be used. If multiple specified 
      last option is used.

    - In case you want to remove a recorder, you need to know the tag for that recorder. Here is an example on how to get the tag of a recorder:

          set tagRc [recorder Node -file nodesD.out -time -node 1 2 3 4 -dof 1 2 disp]


    EXAMPLES

    Generates output file `nodesD.out` that contains relative displacements in x
    and y direction at nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. The output file will contain 9
    columns (time, disp. in x at node 1, disp. in y at node 1, ... , disp. in y
    at node 4))

       recorder Node -file nodesD.out -time -node 1 2 3 4 -dof 1 2 disp;


    For a `UniformExcitation` analysis, this command generates output file
    nodesA.out that contains absolute accelerations (ground motion acceleration
    + relative acceleration) in x direction for nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. NOTE that
    if no TimeSeries is provided and a uniform excitation analysis is
    performed, the relative accelerations are recorded.

       recorder Node -file nodesA.out -timeSeries 1 -time -node 1 2 3 4 -dof 1 accel;
