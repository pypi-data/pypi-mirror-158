Python server to on-the-fly extract and serve vector tiles from a single mbtiles file on S3. This avoids having to have an mbtiles file locally on the server, and means that the update of the tiles can be done by replacing a single object in S3.

Versioning must be enabled on the underlying S3 bucket.
