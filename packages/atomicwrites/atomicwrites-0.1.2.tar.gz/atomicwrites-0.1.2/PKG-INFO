        Atomic file writes.
        
        Features that distinguish it from other similar libraries:
        
        - Race-free assertion that the target file doesn't yet exist. This can be
          controlled with the ``overwrite`` parameter.
        
        - Windows support, although untested. The MSDN resources are not very explicit
          about which operations are atomic. This requires ``pywin32``.
        
        - Simple high-level API that wraps a very flexible class-based API.
        
        Usage::
        
            from atomicwrites import atomic_write
        
            with atomic_write('foo.txt') as f:
                f.write('Hello world.')
                # "foo.txt" doesn't exist yet.
        
            # Now it does.
