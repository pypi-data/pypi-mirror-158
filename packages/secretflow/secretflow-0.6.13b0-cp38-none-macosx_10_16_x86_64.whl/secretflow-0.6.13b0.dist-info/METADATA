SecretFlow is a unified framework for privacy-preserving data intelligence and machine learning. To achieve this goal,
it provides:

- An abstract device layer consists of plain devices and secret devices which encapsulate various cryptographic protocols.
- A device flow layer modeling higher algorithms as device object flow and DAG.
- An algorithm layer to do data analysis and machine learning with horizontal or vertical partitioned data.
- A workflow layer that seamlessly integrates data processing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Install

For users who want to try SecretFlow, you can install the current release
from [pypi](https://pypi.org/). Note that it requires python version >
=3.8, you can create a virtual environment with conda if not satisfied.

```sh
pip install -U secretflow
```

Try you first SecretFlow program

```python
>>> import secretflow as sf
>>> sf.init(['alice', 'bob', 'carol'], num_cpus=8, log_to_driver=True)
>>> dev = sf.PYU('alice')
>>> import numpy as np
>>> data = dev(np.random.rand)(3, 4)
>>> data
<secretflow.device.device.pyu.PYUObject object at 0x7fdec24a15b0>
```
