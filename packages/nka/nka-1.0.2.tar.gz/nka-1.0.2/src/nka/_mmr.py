    and the document.

    MMR considers the similarity of keywords/keyphrases with the
    document, along with the similarity of already selected
    keywords and keyphrases. This results in a selection of keywords
    that maximize their within diversity with respect to the document.

    Args:
        candidates_doc_sim: Cosine scores between the doc and the candidates.
        candidates_sim: Cosine scores within the candidates itself.
        candidates: The selected candidates.
        top_n: The number of keywords to return.
        diversity: How diverse the select keywords/keyphrases are.
                   Values between 0 and 1 with 0 being not diverse at all
                   and 1 being most diverse.

    Returns:
        List[Tuple[str, float]]: Keywords with their doc similarities.
