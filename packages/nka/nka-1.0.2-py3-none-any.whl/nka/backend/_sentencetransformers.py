"""Implements a neural keyword assignment model using sentence transformers API.

    Typical usage example:

    To create a model, you can load in a string pointing to a
    sentence-transformers model:

    from nka.backend import SentenceTransformerBackend
    sentence_model =
        SentenceTransformerBackend("paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2")

    or you can instantiate a model yourself:
    from nka.backend import SentenceTransformerBackend
    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
    embedding_model = SentenceTransformer("paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2")
    sentence_model = SentenceTransformerBackend(embedding_model)
"""
from typing import List, Union

import numpy as np
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from nka.backend._abc_embedder import ABCEmbedder


class SentenceTransformerBackend(ABCEmbedder):
    """ Sentence-transformers embedding model.

    This class accepts a string pointing to a specific transorfer model oder a
    sentence_transformer object to be used as an embedding model.
    """

    def __init__(self, model: Union[str, SentenceTransformer]):

        elif isinstance(model, str):
            self.model = SentenceTransformer(model)
        else:
            raise ValueError(

        Returns:
