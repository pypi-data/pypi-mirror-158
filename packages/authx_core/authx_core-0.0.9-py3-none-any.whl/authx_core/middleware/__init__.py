"""
Based on https://github.com/steinnes/timing-asgi.git

The middleware from this module is intended for use during both development and production,
but only reports timing data at the granularity of individual endpoint calls.

For more detailed performance investigations (during development only, due to added overhead),
consider using the coroutine-aware profiling library `yappi`.
