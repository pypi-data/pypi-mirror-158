## Features

Utilities to help reduce boilerplate and reuse common functionality, Based to
Support Building of [Authx](https://authx.yezz.me) &amp; Authx-lite âš¡:

- **SQLAlchemy Sessions**: The `AuthxDB` class provides an easily-customized
  SQLAlchemy Session dependency.
  - **Asynchronous Sessions**: The `authxAsyncGetEngine` function returns a
    `AsyncResult` object, which can be used to wait for the engine to be ready.
- **Middleware**: Log basic timing information for every request.
- **Inferring Router**: Let FastAPI infer the `response_model` to use based on
  your return type annotation.
- **OpenAPI Simplification**: Simplify your OpenAPI Operation IDs for cleaner
  output from OpenAPI Generator.
- **Views**: Stop repeating the same dependencies over and over in the signature
  of related endpoints.
- **Repeated Tasks**: Easily trigger periodic tasks on server startup.

It also adds a variety of more basic utilities that are useful across a wide
variety of projects:

- **GUID Type**: The provided GUID type makes it easy to use UUIDs as the
  primary keys for your database tables.
- **Enums**: The `authxStrEnum` and `authxCamelStrEnum` classes make
  string-valued enums easier to maintain.
- **CamelCase & SnakeCase**: Convenience functions for converting strings from
  `authxSnake` to `authxCamel` and vice versa.
- **authxModel**: A reusable `pydantic.BaseModel` derived base class with useful
  defaults.
- **authxAPISettings**: A subclass of `pydantic.BaseSettings` that makes it easy
  to configure FastAPI through environment variables.

## Requirements

This package is intended for use with any recent version of FastAPI (depending
on `pydantic` and `FastAPI` and `SQLAlchemy`), and Python 3.8+.
