__Documentation__

- Implement starting point API and write docs on this.


- In this section, include docs on writing and loading models / collections with jsons and adding them together.
- Include docs on the Dictable object from autoconf.
- Model COllection addition not working?
- Animation of 1D Gaussian fitting.

__Complaints__

- Explicit exampels of how to extend Analsyis (e.g. putting extra data in c0nstructor) for Python beginners.

- Amy was unsure how to use an instance to plot a new component. Show an example where an instance is used

__Samples__

 - Have as_instance=True default argument in all Samples objects. Use decorator to implement the output.

__Searches__

- LBFGS: Limits on parameters, callback history.


__Database__

- Database: profiling tests, speed ups and tools. Use test mode to quickly generate large result libearies.
- Database Storage, not needing full Dynesty etc, only store basics, no properties so we can remake each object.


__Graphical Models__

- Graphical models: model.info file, on-the-fly summary file, output of KL divergence / evidence in factors,
  model.results of overall model. For output, include a single file which is the latest results and a folder with
  all factor results, tilted, etc. FactorGraphResult.
