Description: Remote Actions
        ==============
        
        The Remote Actions package, and accompanying REMOTEACTION module, are
        used to integrate Orchid Extender's Workflow for Sage 300 with fleetingremote
        actions.io to securely collect well formed, validated, data from users or
        customers from outside of Sage 300.
        
        The Remote Actions package, and the `Fleeting Forms`_ service that it uses to
        generate one time pages, were created and are maintained by 
        `Poplar Development`_.
