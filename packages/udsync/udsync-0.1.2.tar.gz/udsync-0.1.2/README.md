An interactive urwid based directory synchronizer.
Similar to [Free File Sync](https://freefilesync.org/) but in a terminal and with the possibility to expand and collapse directories to keep the list of changes to a manageable size.

WARNING:
This is work in progress.
Showing the differences between two directories (or several directory pairs) is already possible but the syncronization is not implemented yet.

usage:
```bash
udsync <sourcedir> <targetdir>
udsync [<backupplan>]
```
