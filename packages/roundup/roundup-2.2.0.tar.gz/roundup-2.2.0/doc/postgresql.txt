PostgreSQL/psycopg Backend
==========================

This are notes about PostqreSQL backend based on the psycopg adapter for
Roundup issue tracker.

Prerequisites
=============

To use PostgreSQL as backend for storing roundup data, you should
additionally install:

1. PostgreSQL_ 8.x or higher

2. The psycopg_ python interface to PostgreSQL_

Note that you currently need at least version 2.8 of psycopg_ -- the
postgresql backend will work with 2.7 but if you're using the native
postgresql indexer you need at least 2.8. Also if you want to run the
tests, these also need 2.8. If your distribution has an older version we
suggest that you install into a python virtual environment.

.. _PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/



Running the PostgreSQL unit tests
=================================

The user that you're running the tests as will need to be able to access
the postgresql database on the local machine and create and drop
databases. See the config values in 'test/db_test_base.py' 
about which database connection, name and user will be used.
