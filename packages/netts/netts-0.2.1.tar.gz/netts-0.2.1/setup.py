Speech transcripts are short paragraphs of largely raw, uncleaned speech-like text. For example:\n\n> 'I see a man and he is wearing a jacket. He is standing in the dark against a light post. On the picture there seems to be like a park and... Or trees but in those trees there are little balls of light reflections as well. I cannot see the... Anything else because it’s very dark. But the man on the picture seems to wear a hat and he seems to have a hoodie on as well. The picture is very mysterious, which I like about it, but for me I would like to understand more about the picture.'\n> -- <cite>Example Transcript</cite>\n\nBelow is the semantic speech graph constructed from this text.\n\n![Semantic speech graph example](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/netts/raw/main/docs/docs/img/real_example_network_with_picture_transcript.png)\n*Figure 1. Semantic Speech Graph. Nodes represents an entity mentioned by the speaker (e.g. I, man, jacket). Edges represent relations between nodes mentioned by the speaker (e.g. see, has on).*\n\n## Getting started\n\nRead the full documentation [here](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/netts/).\n\n### Where to get it\n\nYou can install the latest release from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/netts/)\n\n```bash\npip install netts\n```\n\nor get the latest development version from GitHub (not stable)\n\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/netts\n```\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\nNetts requires a few additional dependencies to work which you can download with the netts CLI that was installed by pip\n\n```bash\nnetts install\n```\n\n### Basic usage\n\nThe quickest way to process a transcript is with the CLI.\n\n```bash\nnetts run transcript.txt outputs\n```\n\nwhere `transcript.txt` is a text file containing transcribed speech and `outputs` is the name of a directory to write the outputs to.\n\n## Contributors\n\nNetts was written by [Caroline Nettekoven](https://www.caroline-nettekoven.com) in collaboration with [Sarah Morgan](https://semorgan.org).\n\nNetts was packaged in collaboration with [Oscar Giles](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/oscar-giles), [Iain Stenson](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-engineering/meet-the-team) and [Helen Duncan](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/research-engineering/helen-duncan).\n\n<!-- ## Citing netts\n\nIf you use netts in your work, please cite this paper:\n> Caroline R.
